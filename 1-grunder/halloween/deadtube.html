        <p>Tomohiro Machiya, a member of the Film Research Club, is called by school idol, Mai Mashiro, to film her.<br>
             After he films her swimming, she asks him to film her continuously for two days and he agrees.<br>
              Everything seems normal until Mashiro kills her "boyfriend" who was a former bully and delinquent, while Machiya films it all.<br>
               He then finds out Mashiro is uploading videos to a website called Dead Tube, where users post content and are rewarded <br>
                with money based on the number of views they get. The users are encouraged to post videos, but there is a catch:<br>
                 the person or people whose video gets the fewest views has to pay for the expenses and the crimes of all the other participants.<br>
                  As Machiya gets dragged deeper and deeper into the world of Dead Tube, he starts questioning his ambiguous relationship<br>
                   with Mashiro and the dark feelings lying within himself.</p>
